A Worldwide Public Activity Map


Rationale
--------

Our culture is yearning to flower.


Implementation
--------

The goal is to have three types of markers on a single Google Map for everyone.

**Play**  
Time for some freeze tag?  Put a Play marker on the map to let everyone know.  Play is a general thing.  There's nothing to them besides the marker and a countdown which can be increased in a simple manner, such as double-clicking it.

**Event**  
An Event is a specific activity.  It has a title and different time scheme than Play.

**Camp**  
Camps are persistent places with a simple interface.  They require a passphrase to move around or edit.  Clicking on a camp brings up it's categories and items.  The default categories would be "Items" and "Skills", but categories are up the neighborhood, as are the items placed in each category.  Items are abstract; they can have any meaning.

That's all there is to it.
